Throughout this lesson, I learned how to select HTML elements with CSS and apply styles to them. 

<li>CSS can select HTML elements by type, class, ID, and attribute.</li>
<li>All elements can be selected using the universal selector.</li>
<li>An element can have different states using the pseudo-class selector.</li>
<li>Multiple CSS classes can be applied to one HTML element.</li>
<li>Classes can be reusable, while IDs can only be used once.</li>
<li>IDs are more specific than classes, and classes are more specific than type. That means IDs will override any styles from a class, and classes will override any styles from a type selector.</li>
<li>Multiple selectors can be chained together to select an element. This raises the specificity but can be necessary.</li>
<li>Nested elements can be selected by separating selectors with a space.</li>
<li>Multiple unrelated selectors can receive the same styles by separating the selector names with commas.</li>
